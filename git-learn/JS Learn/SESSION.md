# SESSION

Hand-written. The one file that records what is *in flight* — everything
measurable lives in `PROGRESS.md`, which is generated, and the narrative of
**why** anything was done lives in `HANDOFF.md`.

Written **before** starting a unit of work, updated when it lands. If a session
dies mid-edit, this already says what was being attempted; `git status` shows
how far it got.

---

## In progress

**M3 on A5**, started 2026-08-19. Working from `3b43bc7`.

`a5/0001` is **done and verified**. Next up is `a5/0002` (QR generation and
scanning) — not yet started, nothing uncommitted.

## Next action

If `a5/0001` lands: continue down A5 — `0002` QR, `0003` list management,
`0004` access rules, `0005` share-path warnings. One commit per lesson, so an
abrupt stop loses at most one.

| Work | Gate |
|---|---|
| **M3** — extract the plain function from the remaining ~19 logic-rich lessons | none; A5 is the next module and the largest |
| A TypeScript-aware runner, so `a2/*` and `a3/0002` can be verified | needs a decision first — see *Open questions* |
| **Phase 3** — the ten C-modules | just-in-time; the student is nowhere near |
| **Phase 4** — the operating track | after launch |
| The three orphan tables | behind the B2 rewrite, itself behind C5/E2EE. Parked in `scripts/known-issues.json` |
| The one remaining warning — a dead `privacy-policy.html` link in legacy `07` | legacy module, outside the token track |

**Do not ask the student where they are in Module 01.** They asked on
2026-08-18 not to be asked again. Do not infer it from the files either — that
inference is what produced the "Modules 1 and 2 complete" claim that mispitched
the course for months. Pitch to the profile in `CLAUDE.md` and let them steer.

### Open questions for the student

1. **How far ahead of yourself should this build?** M3 is real work that keeps
   finding real defects, but every lesson it touches is modules ahead of Module
   01. Raised twice; the answer both times was to continue.
2. **Is a TypeScript-aware runner worth building?** Four lessons can never be
   verified without one. It is the only category that a rewrite cannot fix.

## Blocked on

Nothing.

## Phase status

Per-item status only. The plan itself is in `TOKEN-TRACK.md`; the counts are in
`PROGRESS.md`; why any of it went the way it did is in `HANDOFF.md`.

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 0 — repair the map | done |
| 1 — unblock where the student is | **done**, all five items |
| 1.5 — the practice pattern in Module 02 | **done** — all 14, 2026-08-17 |
| 2 — deepen the spine | done (16 of 16 deepenable; 4 deliberately skipped as rewrites) |
| 3 — the ten C-modules | not started, deliberately |
| 4 — the operating track | not started, deliberately |
| M1 — verify what was never executed | done |
| M2 — the invalid example codes | done |
| **M3 — the plain function in Track A/B lessons** | **started 2026-08-18** — A3 and A4 done, ~19 left |

### M3 — where it has reached

The pattern: find the pure function the lesson is really about, excuse the
un-runnable exercise with a **per-exercise** `unverifiable` reason, add a
`createSolution` + self-check, write the `--wrong` cases, verify.

| Lesson | Function | The thing it pins down |
|---|---|---|
| `a3/0001` | `buildUrl` | one slash; `0`/`false` kept, `null` dropped; encoding |
| `a3/0003` | `retryPlan` | a 429 **is** retryable; honour `Retry-After`, including `0` |
| `a3/0004` | `applyPage` | stale → same object; refresh replaces; dedupe inside *and* against |
| `a4/0001` | `decideStartup` | only 401/403 ends a session |
| `a4/0002` | `screensFor` | a forbidden screen does not exist, it is not covered |
| `a4/0003` | `planFor` | the `isRetry` guard; a 403 is not refreshable |
| `a5/0001` | `codeFromBytes` | 248 is *inside* the fold, 247 is not; short block → `null` |

**A5 note:** `0001` had no `createExplain` prompt and did not load `explain.js`
at all. Check the rest of A5 for the same gap — the module predates the practice
pattern being made universal, so it is unlikely to be the only one.

Remaining, roughly: **~18 have an extractable function** (A5 ×5, A6, A8 ×4,
A11, B2, B3, B5, B7, B10 …), **~40 are genuinely infra** (a device, a VPS, two
phones, a live TURN server), and **4 are TypeScript**, which the runner cannot
execute at all.

## Notes for the next session

Durable gotchas only. Anything narrative is in `HANDOFF.md`.

### Writing a lesson

- **`--wrong` mistakes take `impl`, not `code`.** Getting it wrong yields a row
  of identical `ReferenceError`s that look like a verifier bug and are not.
- **Choose fixture values that differ from what a wrong answer produces.** Five
  self-checks in Phase 1.5 passed a wrong answer by coincidence. Every one was
  caught by a wrong-case, never by the self-check passing. In M3 this means
  things like a 12-second `Retry-After` (unlike any backoff value) and a
  3-held/2-incoming page that overlaps by one *and* repeats one of its own.
- **Where a mistake can throw rather than return, wrap that check on its own.**
  An uncaught throw aborts every check below it and hides what it never reached.
- **Look for the plain function before reaching for `--unverifiable`.** Wrong
  four times out of four in Phase 1.5, and wrong six times out of six in M3.
- **Never bulk-edit lesson content through a shell**, not only when writing it.
  A blanket replacement injected real newlines into four quiz strings in `0011`.
- **Never write an option that refers to the other options** — not "All of the
  above" (the audit errors) and not "All three" (the audit cannot see it).
  Restructure so each option stands alone.
- **Never write an explanation that names an option by letter or place.**
  `render-as-authored` is 0; if it rises, one has crept back in.

### Verifying a lesson

- **`--unverifiable` is a property of the lesson, not of the run**, and
  `verification-log.json` is the only place it is recorded. Running
  `verify-lesson` without it fails on the missing self-check, and **a failing
  run deletes the entry**, so the lesson silently drops to `unverified`. Check
  the log before re-verifying a lesson you did not write.
- **Prefer the per-exercise opt-out** — `createSolution(id, { unverifiable: … })`
  — to the whole-lesson flag. The whole-lesson flag skips *every* solution.
- **At least one exercise must actually execute** or the status stays
  `unverifiable`. That guard is what stops the opt-out becoming a way to mark
  work done by declaring it undoable.
- **Commit before running an injection test.** `git checkout --` reverts
  uncommitted work along with the injected damage; this cost the same edit twice.

### Tooling limits worth knowing

- `verify-lesson.mjs` shims `setTimeout`/`clearTimeout` onto a drainable queue
  but **does not model Node's phase ordering** — `process.nextTick` and
  `setImmediate` questions are skipped, because the sandbox gets them wrong.
- `setInterval` is still not shimmed. It has not bitten anything yet.
- **The runner executes JavaScript.** A TypeScript solution cannot be verified
  at all, however it is rewritten. That is the whole `a2/*` + `a3/0002` category.
- The `dom-sandbox` selector engine has no `>`, `+`, `~` or pseudo-classes. If a
  lesson needs one, add it to the sandbox *and* to `scripts/test-dom-sandbox.mjs`
  in the same commit.
- **`verify-lesson.mjs` has no opinion about display `<pre>` blocks.**
  `check-pre-blocks.mjs` covers that gap and runs inside the audit as an error.
  Its scope is one defect — an unterminated `'`/`"` in a JS block. It is **not**
  a syntax check, deliberately: the blocks are JSX, fragments, SQL and shell.
- **When a check is tuned to silence false positives, write the suite that
  proves it still fires.** `check-pre-blocks` went 71 → 0 across three
  suppressions; `test-check-pre-blocks.mjs` is the only thing distinguishing a
  clean course from a dead check.
- **Do not assume a stem covers its inflections.** `\bcorrect\b` does not match
  "correctly", and that one word boundary hid 17 inverted questions from a check
  written to find exactly them.

### Audit conventions

- **The audit exits OK as of 2026-08-18** — the first time in the project's
  history. Treat any red audit as real from here on; that is the point of having
  made it green.
- **Warnings are down to 1**, a genuine dead link in legacy `07`. Both former
  token warnings were correct content. Treat a warning as real now.
- `scripts/known-issues.json` parks real-but-gated errors with a **why** and a
  **gate**. **Acknowledged is not fixed.** An entry matching no error fails as
  stale — when B2 lands, that failure is the signal to delete the entry, not
  re-word it.
- **`audit-allow-token-fixtures`** (file-level) exempts a lesson whose subject
  *is* invalid codes — `02/0004` and `01/0012`. **`audit-allow-token-here`**
  (line-level) is for a file that must keep being scanned but names a bad code
  once; `CLAUDE.md` is its only user. The alphabet check is an error and still
  applies to opted-out files.

### Standing facts

- **Student progress is never inferred from the files**, and as of 2026-08-18
  the student has asked not to be asked either.
- **When the student reaches `01/0013`** they need Node 19+ (`node -v`) —
  `crypto.getRandomValues` as a global is Module 01's only environment
  requirement.
- **Module 02's framing cleanup is done.** Four `avatar`/`chat` hits remain **on
  purpose** — the "a chat app shows a face here, Token cannot" contrasts at
  `0002:400-401`, `0003:370`, `0013:76`, `0014:33`. Do not "finish the job".
- **When checking for framing, grep the colours too.** The word-grep missed 95
  WhatsApp-palette hexes across 13 files — the biggest signal in the module.
- **A reframe that stops at the prose leaves crashes behind.** Five Module 02
  lessons had a live `TypeError`, `ReferenceError` or blank row where the
  reframed narrative met un-reframed fixtures. Check *every* row of a sample
  list; the defect was always in the entries nobody re-read.
- **A rename is never just the file.** `02/0013` reached into
  `search-index.json`, the module README, the nav in two lessons, the wrong-case
  file's name *and* its header comment, and `verification-log.json` — which is
  generated, so prune the stale key with a script and let a real run write the
  new one.
- **Reframing a lesson around its function keeps finding contradictions between
  lessons.** Three so far, each a page stating a rule that a neighbour's code
  breaks. When you write the function, check the neighbours.
